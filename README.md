To generate the **figures**, navigate to the scripts/ folder and run the corresponding Python scripts. For example:

python3 plot_fig2.py,
python3 plot_fig3.py, ...


The **plot_fig2** script reads raw experimental data for motor protein intensities, processes and normalizes the data to account for variations in axonal volume, and produces a publication-ready figure with three panels that illustrate:

The raw UNC-104 intensity profile,
The mScarlet fluorophore intensity profile,
The normalized ratio indicating the motor protein density per unit volume.
